# String

My own implementation of the `std::string` class.

**Key features:**
* Manual dynamic memory management (tracks size and capacity).
* Fast `push_back` and `pop_back` (O(1) time).
* Overloaded operators for string math (`+`, `+=`, `==`, `<`, etc.).
* Implemented `find`, `substr`, and other standard methods.
